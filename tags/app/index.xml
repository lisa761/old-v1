      <description>About Me I am a second-year undergraduate, pursuing Computer Science Engineering at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women.
I have a fair amount of experience with web development and have used it to create several projects. I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and am actively working to learn more about them as I go. I constantly push myself to learn more and do better.</description>
