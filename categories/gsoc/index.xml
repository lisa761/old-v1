      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent this week working on the rendering functions. Since these functions take up the most time during the loading of rows, it was important to make them as efficient as is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, I spent time working on the reset of the scroll bar position while doing facets. The intention is to avoid resetting in cases where the data set does not change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The focus for the end of this week was to get ready with a basic prototype that can be released to the users. Therefore, most of the work was testing and finding bugs in the current working code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The normal upwards scrolling and the virtual scroll, both go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, I started working on the faster scrolling aspect. This was closely related to virtual scrolling, so it was time I got into that as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first week of the coding period, I spent more time studying for my end semester exams than working on the project itself. But I did work on clearing up some things that I had finished up beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
